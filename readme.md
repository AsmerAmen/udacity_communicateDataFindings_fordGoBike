# Ford GoBike Data Analysis
## By Asmer Amen

## Introduction
- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
- This notebook explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing bike rides from 2018. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as user type, gender, and age.

## Project overview
1. Data Gathering
    - I choose Ford GoBike bike ride data for 2018. 
    - The data was downloaded from here https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. 
    - The data is about bike ride trips, Each trip is anonymized and includes:
        - Trip Duration (seconds)
        - Start Time and Date
        - End Time and Date
        - Start Station ID
        - Start Station Name
        - Start Station Latitude
        - Start Station Longitude
        - End Station ID
        - End Station Name
        - End Station Latitude
        - End Station Longitude
        - Bike ID
        - User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)

2. Data Exploring
    - I'll Explore the data and document my findings in a report. The report will briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that I conducted.
3. Data Explaining
    - At the end of the exploration, I'll probably have a bunch of things that I’ve discovered. So I'm going to organize my findings and select a story that I will convey to others. Then summarize my main findings and reflect on the steps I took in my data exploration in this readme document.

## Summary of Findings
1. Members tend to go for rdie trip on spring, summer and fall more than winter. and on week days rather than week ends, spceially on the time to commute to and from work.
2. Most of the members are males.
3. Members with age range of 30-40 have the most records to use bikes, specially for males. However, their trip duration avrage is less than women.
4. Trip duration average varies for age ranges, where the best is 10-20 then 20-30 and 50-60.
5. Since number of subscriber user is almost 8 times customer user, they define the trend when it comes to total count of rides over the year months. However cutomer user have bigger trip duration.

## Key Insights for Presentation
- For the presentation, I focus on the influence of months, weekday, time and age group of bike trips data.
